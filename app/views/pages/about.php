                <p class="lead">
                    After an intense and challenging 7 years working in the heavy industry, I needed a new boost, Loved
                    computers since I was young and curios about how games work.
                    <br>
                    So here I am!

                    "What should I do next?" The question that all of us had at least one time.
                    <br>
                    This question started putting my wheels in motion. <br>
                    The answer was simple: "I would like to learn something new!". <br>So I started a conversation with
                    my girlfriend (now my lovely wife), she suggested unexpectedly to start a course of Computer
                    Science. It was love at first word, so I started searching what should I learn and after some days
                    of researching I decided to do BackEnd Development.
                    <br>
                    Long story short, here I am now, working on my first project!
